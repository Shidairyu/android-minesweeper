            explained at the end of the help pages.

            Easy: 20 bombs to detect\n
            Medium: 40 bombs\n
            Hard: 60 bombs

            The principle of Minesweeper is to mark all bombs with a flag without revealing one.
            Once a bomb has been tapped, the game is over. \n
            As an aid, the number of bombs in immediate vicinity is displayed when fields are uncovered.
            Through logical deduction you can find the fields with a bomb underneath it.\n
            Single-Click: Reveal field\n
            Long-Click: Flag the field as bomb

            If the brightness of white is to damaging to your eyes, you can choose to use the
            darkmode which we kindly provided.
            To toggle it, simply go to the start-screen and flip the rescuing switch.
            Your selection will be stored, so that you dont get blinded if you want to play
            Minesweeper in the morning after waking up.
