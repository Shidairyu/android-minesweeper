# android-minesweeper
## Description
Our own implementation of the legendary Minesweeper game inside an Android App. <br>
It includes varying difficulties to choose from and a high-score list to check out your best runs.
A simple help page explains the games mechanics and the other parts of the app.
There is also an included darkmode to lessen the strain on your eyes (especially at night ðŸ˜‰)
