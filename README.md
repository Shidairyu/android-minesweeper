# android-minesweeper
## Description
Our own implementation of the legendary Minesweeper game inside an Android App. <br>
It includes varying difficulties to choose from and a high-score list to check out your best runs.
A simple help page explains the games mechanics and the other parts of the app.
There is also an included darkmode to lessen the strain on your eyes (especially at night 😉) 

## Which points we want to achieve
